# `--no-shell` skips chromium-headless-shell, saving ~100 MiB. That is only
# safe because every launch site passes channel="chromium" (see
# src/afas_declaraties/session.py), which runs full Chromium in new-headless
# mode. A plain `p.chromium.launch(headless=True)` resolves to the shell and
# dies with:
#
#   Executable doesn't exist at /ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-*/...
#   Looks like Playwright was just installed or updated.
#
# That message points at the install, not at the caller, so it wastes an hour.
# If a new launch site ever needs plain headless, drop --no-shell here rather
# than debugging the browser.
#
# `--with-deps` shells out to apt for the system libs, so clean up after it.
