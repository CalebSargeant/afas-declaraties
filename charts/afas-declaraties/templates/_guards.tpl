Preflight checks.

Every one of these describes a failure that is slow and misleading to diagnose
once it is running in a cluster: a pod in ImagePullBackOff that looks like a
registry credentials problem, a CrashLoopBackOff whose log says "DATABASE_URL
is required" three seconds after every restart, or — worst of all — a live run
that files real expense claims because a value defaulted the wrong way.
`fail` turns each into an immediate, readable `helm template` error.

Included once from NOTES.txt, so they run on template, install and upgrade.

Cross-field rules live here rather than in values.schema.json because JSON
Schema cannot express them with a message worth reading.
