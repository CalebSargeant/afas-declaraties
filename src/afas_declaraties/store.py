"""The claim ledger, on the shared CNPG Postgres.

This is the system of record, not AFAS. AFAS is an output format: a portal
change, a rejected line or a lost session must never lose the knowledge of what
was worked where. Raw SQL with idempotent DDL, matching the house pattern in
github-timesheet -- no ORM, no migration tool.

The central invariant is structural rather than procedural: ``claim_day`` is
keyed by date, so a single day physically cannot hold both a commute and a
working-from-home claim. Art. 31a lid 12 Wet LB 1964 makes those two mutually
exclusive per day, and an invariant that matters this much should be enforced
by the database rather than by remembering to check.
