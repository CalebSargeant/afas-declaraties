"""Reading the work calendar out of Outlook Web.

Why scrape rather than call an API: this tenant does not grant app
registrations, so Microsoft Graph is unavailable. The alternatives were a
published-ICS capability URL (world-readable, and it silently truncates to a
rolling three-month window) or borrowing the access token OWA mints in-page for
its own first-party client -- which is the token-replay shape security tooling
is built to flag. Driving the page as the signed-in user is the honest option
and reuses the Entra session the job already holds.

OWA puts the whole event description in each element's ``aria-label``:

    Booking (A / Desk 1.01 / Zone A), all day event, Monday, August 31, 2026, By deskbird, Free
    Daily standup, 8:45 AM to 9:30 AM, Monday, August 31, 2026, By A Colleague, Busy, Recurring event

Parsing is kept separate from the browser so the fragile half is unit-testable
against captured strings, with no login required.
