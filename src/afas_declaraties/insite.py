"""Driving the AFAS InSite verzameldeclaratie forms.

Both claim types use the same form, differing only by page slug. One row per
day: booking date, year, period and a count.

Three things about this form drove the design, all established by driving the
real thing:

1. **Period does not follow the date.** A fresh row is prefilled with the
   *current* month regardless of the booking date, so filing August days in
   September silently books them into period 9. Every row therefore sets the
   period explicitly and verifies it.
2. **Every field lives in shadow DOM, and the value lives in a different place
   per component type.** Date and number components hold it on the inner
   ``<input>`` property; ``afas-reference`` holds it on the host's ``value``
   attribute. Reading the wrong one returns ``None`` and looks like an empty
   form.
3. **The window index is a per-page-load counter.** Fields are
   ``Window_<n>_Declaratie_HrZ50_<code>`` and ``<n>`` becomes 1 after the first
   ``Nieuw``, more if any dialog opened first. It is discovered, never assumed.

Nothing is persisted until ``Aanmaken``, and even that only creates a draft
task the employee can still edit or delete. The irreversible step is
"Declaratie insturen" on that task, which lives in :mod:`submit`, behind an
explicit human approval.
